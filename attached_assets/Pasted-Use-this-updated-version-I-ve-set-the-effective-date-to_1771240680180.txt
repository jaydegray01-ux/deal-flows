I’ve set the effective date to February 16, 2026 and used Deal Flow as the brand name.
Since you don’t have an email yet, I’ve structured it so you can temporarily remove the contact email and add it later.

You should create a basic email soon (like support@dealflow.com). Not having one looks unprofessional and weakens legal protection.
